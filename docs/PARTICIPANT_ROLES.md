# Learning Pulse: Participant Roles and Responsibilities

## Overview

This document clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each participant within the Learning Pulse system. The success of blended learning depends on explicitly defining how teachers, students, and the system itself interact and contribute to the learning process.

## Teacher Role

Teachers are the primary facilitators and educational experts, not merely system operators.

### Responsibilities
- **Learning Path Design**: Create and customize learning paths based on curriculum requirements and student needs
- **Content Curation**: Select, review, and approve learning resources for quality and relevance
- **Progress Monitoring**: Review student progress data to identify intervention needs
- **Pace Management**: Adjust the flexible pace of learning based on classroom context and individual student needs
- **Intervention**: Provide personalized support when the system flags struggling students
- **Assessment Review**: Design and review assessments, with the ability to override automated assessments
- **Feedback Provider**: Offer qualitative feedback that complements the system's quantitative data
- **Learning Coach**: Help students develop metacognitive skills for self-directed learning

### System Tools for Teachers
- Dashboard with class-wide and individual progress views
- Resource management interface for curating content
- Intervention recommendations based on student performance metrics
- Flexible pace adjustment tools per student/class
- Assessment creation and evaluation tools

## Student Role

Students are active participants in their learning journey, not passive recipients.

### Responsibilities
- **Active Learning**: Engage with learning materials and complete assigned activities
- **Self-Assessment**: Reflect on their own understanding and progress
- **Feedback Provider**: Provide feedback on learning resources and activities
- **Peer Collaboration**: Participate in collaborative learning when appropriate
- **Progress Awareness**: Monitor their own progress and set learning goals
- **Help-Seeking**: Identify when they need assistance and reach out appropriately

### System Tools for Students
- Personalized learning dashboard showing progress and next steps
- Self-assessment tools and reflection prompts
- Resource rating and feedback mechanisms
- Goal-setting interface with milestone tracking
- Help request system linking to teacher support

## System Role

The system is a tool and enabler, not a replacement for the teacher.

### Responsibilities
- **Data Collection**: Gather learning activity and assessment data
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and visualize progress toward learning objectives
- **Resource Organization**: Structure and deliver learning content based on curriculum
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Suggest appropriate resources based on student level and progress
- **Analytics**: Provide insights on individual and class-wide learning patterns
- **Administrative Support**: Handle routine administrative tasks to free teacher time

### System Limitations
- **Not the primary instructor**: The system complements rather than replaces teacher instruction
- **Not fully autonomous**: Major decisions require teacher oversight and approval
- **Not the sole assessment method**: System assessments are one component of a broader evaluation
- **Not rigid in pacing**: The system suggests but does not dictate learning pace

## Flexible-Paced Learning

Rather than purely self-paced learning, Learning Pulse implements flexible-paced learning:

- **Teacher-defined parameters**: Teachers set minimum pace expectations and maximum time allowances
- **Progress milestones**: Key checkpoints ensure students maintain appropriate progress
- **Dynamic adjustments**: Pace can be modified based on individual student needs and classroom context
- **Group synchronization points**: Certain topics or activities bring the class together for collaborative learning
- **Intervention triggers**: The system alerts teachers when students fall significantly behind

## Authentic Learning Integration

Learning Pulse bridges system-based learning with authentic tasks:

- **Project integration**: Structured digital learning leads into authentic project work
- **Application activities**: System recommends real-world applications of digital learning
- **Portfolio documentation**: Students document authentic work within the system
- **Reflection prompts**: System guides reflection on connections between digital and authentic learning
- **Assessment balance**: Mix of digital assessments and authentic performance tasks

## Implementation Principles

1. **Collaborative design**: Teachers are involved in system design and improvement
2. **Transparent algorithms**: Learning recommendations and assessments can be reviewed and modified by teachers
3. **Continuous feedback**: Regular mechanisms for all participants to provide feedback
4. **Incremental adoption**: Phased implementation with careful evaluation at each stage
5. **Professional development**: Training for teachers focuses on effective facilitation using the system
