# Project Restructuring Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Duplicate Code**:
   - Eliminated redundant server-side code from the frontend (controllers, models, routes, middleware)
   - Removed duplicated MongoDB models that would cause maintenance issues

2. **Proper Frontend Architecture**:
   - Created a modern React application structure with:
     - components/ - Reusable UI components
     - pages/ - Full page components
     - context/ - React context providers for state management
     - services/ - API service modules to interact with backend
     - hooks/ - Custom React hooks
     - styles/ - CSS stylesheets
     - utils/ - Utility functions

3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Backend (Express/Node.js) focused solely on API endpoints and data management
   - Frontend (React) focused on user interface and experience
   - API communication handled through dedicated service modules

4. **Improved Authentication Flow**:
   - Created a centralized auth context for managing user state
   - Implemented protected routes with proper redirection

## New Project Structure

```
/learning-pulse
  /backend                # Express.js API server
    /config               # Configuration files
    /controllers          # API controllers
    /middleware           # Express middleware
    /models               # MongoDB models
    /routes               # API route definitions
    server.js             # Express app entry point

  /frontend               # React.js client application
    /public               # Static assets
    /src
      /components         # Reusable React components
      /context            # React context providers
      /hooks              # Custom React hooks
      /pages              # Page components
      /services           # API service modules
      /styles             # CSS stylesheets
      /utils              # Utility functions
      App.js              # Main app component
      index.js            # Entry point

  /shared                 # Shared code between frontend/backend
  
  README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Changes to data models only need to be made in the backend
2. **Scalability**: Frontend and backend can be deployed and scaled independently
3. **Performance**: Lighter client application with no server-side processing
4. **Developer Experience**: Clearer separation of concerns makes development more intuitive
5. **Code Reuse**: Shared utilities can be placed in a common location
